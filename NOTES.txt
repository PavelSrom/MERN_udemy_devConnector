- 'start' NPM script is the one Heroku runs when deployed
- db.js => function that we export into server.js than runs our database

SERVER-SIDE VALIDATION:
- Brad uses express-validator for validation
- do validation before you interact with your DB
- view users API routes and see 'Request & body validation' lecture for more info

ROUTES:
- users route: ignore the gratavar stuff, that's just for a profile image
